              <p class="headline font-weight-thin">
                Booklets are an untapped resource for marketing. These print products are a great platform for an information-rich and visually appealing product. Houston Chronicle contributor Neil Kokemuller cited booklets as one of the most versatile marketing tools in the game. These bite-sized pamphlets are easily distributed at expos or community events and can be littered with key details about your company services.

              <p class="headline font-weight-thin">
                Flyers are a versatile form of marketing. They are fairly easy to create, print, and distribute, and they have several uses.Posters tend to be fairly large and professionally printed, and almost always feature an illustration, while flyers (also known as miniposters) are usually 8 ½" x 11" or so, might be simply photocopied or e-mailed, and often rely solely on words to get their point across.
